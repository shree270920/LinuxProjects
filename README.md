# Linux System Monitor Script

A simple shell script to continuously monitor CPU, Memory, and Disk usage on a Linux system in real-time. It displays the current usage percentages and provides alerts if predefined thresholds are exceeded.

This project serves as a practical exercise for learning foundational Linux shell scripting concepts.

## Features

*   Monitors CPU usage percentage.
*   Monitors Memory usage percentage.
*   Monitors Disk usage percentage (highest usage across relevant partitions).
*   Displays statistics clearly in the terminal, refreshing periodically.
*   Provides alerts when CPU, Memory, or Disk usage exceeds configurable thresholds.
*   Configurable refresh interval.

## Core Commands Used

The script leverages several standard Linux utilities:

*   **Looping & Timing:** `while`, `do`, `done`, `sleep`
*   **Display & Info:** `clear`, `date`, `echo`
*   **Resource Monitoring:** `vmstat`, `free`, `df`
*   **Text Processing:** `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, `head`, `tail`, `sort`
*   **Conditional Logic:** `if`, `then`, `fi`

## Prerequisites

*   A Linux-based operating system (including WSL on Windows).
*   **Bash shell:** Typically located at `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/bash`.
*   Standard Linux core utilities (`vmstat`, `free`, `df`, `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, etc. - usually installed by default).
*   **(Optional but Recommended if Editing on Windows):** `dos2unix` utility to fix potential line ending issues. Install using `sudo apt install dos2unix` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install dos2unix` / `sudo dnf install dos2unix` (CentOS/Fedora/RHEL).

## Setup

1.  **Save the Script:** Save the provided script code into a file named `system_monitor.sh`.
2.  **Verify Shebang Line:** Open the script (`nano system_monitor.sh`) and ensure the very first line (the "shebang") points to the correct location of your bash interpreter.
    *   Run `which bash` in your terminal to find the path (e.g., `/usr/bin/bash` or `/bin/bash`).
    *   Make sure the first line of the script matches exactly, for example: `#!/usr/bin/bash`
3.  **Fix Line Endings (If Necessary):** If you created or edited the script on Windows, run `dos2unix` to ensure correct Linux line endings:
    ```bash
    dos2unix system_monitor.sh
    ```
4.  **Make Executable:** Grant execute permission to the script:
    ```bash
    chmod +x system_monitor.sh
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    ./system_monitor.sh
    ```
2.  **Observe:** The terminal will clear, and the script will display the current CPU, Memory, and Disk usage statistics. The display refreshes every few seconds (5 seconds by default). If any resource usage exceeds its configured threshold, an alert message will appear below the statistics.
3.  **Stop the Script:** Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the script is running.

## Configuration

You can easily customize the behavior of the script by modifying the variables at the top:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash # Or /bin/bash

# --- Configuration ---
CPU_THRESHOLD=80  # Alert if CPU usage >= 80%
MEM_THRESHOLD=85  # Alert if Memory usage >= 85%
DISK_THRESHOLD=90 # Alert if Disk usage (highest) >= 90%
SLEEP_INTERVAL=5  # Refresh data every 5 seconds


CPU_THRESHOLD: The CPU usage percentage that triggers an alert.

MEM_THRESHOLD: The Memory usage percentage that triggers an alert.

DISK_THRESHOLD: The Disk usage percentage (for the most utilized partition monitored) that triggers an alert.

SLEEP_INTERVAL: The time in seconds between each refresh of the statistics.

How It Works Briefly

Infinite Loop: The while true; do ... done structure keeps the script running.

Clear Screen: clear provides a clean slate for each update.

Timestamp: date adds a current timestamp.

CPU Usage: vmstat is used to get the CPU idle percentage, which is then subtracted from 100 to get the active usage.

Memory Usage: free -m provides memory details. awk extracts total and available memory to calculate the usage percentage. (Available is used as it's often a better indicator of usable memory than just free).

Disk Usage: df -P lists disk partitions. grep, awk, sed, sort, and head are chained together to filter relevant partitions, extract the usage percentage, remove the '%', and find the highest percentage value.

Alerting: if statements compare the calculated usage values against the configured _THRESHOLD variables. Alerts are printed via echo if thresholds are met or exceeded.

Pause: sleep pauses the script for SLEEP_INTERVAL seconds before the next loop iteration.
